# Show flight tracks of the HALO aircraft interactively

This notebook shows how to plot the flight tracks of the HALO aircraft. First, we'll have only a quick look and later on we do some more work in order to get the data onto an interactive map.

## Preparations
First, we'll import pylab and the EUREC4A data catalog.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%pylab inline
import eurec4a
cat = eurec4a.get_intake_catalog()
```

### Restructuring the dataset
When inspecting the contents of the currently available BAHAMAS quicklook dataset, we see that it does not handle coordinates according to the ideas of [CF conventions](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html), which makes using the data a lot more difficult.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ds = cat.HALO.BAHAMAS.QL['HALO-0122'].to_dask()
ds
```

In order to fix that a bit, we could come up with a little function which transforms the dataset we get into a dataset we would like to have. Of course the proper way of handling this would be to actually fix the dataset, but this way of doing it may still be illustrative.
Another advantage of this preparatory step is that amount of data in the dataset can be reduced, such that when we later load the datasets early, less data will be fetched.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def fix_halo_ql(ds):
    import xarray as xr
    ds = ds.rename({"tid":"time"})
    return xr.Dataset({
        "time": ds.TIME,
        "lat": ds.IRS_LAT,
        "lon": ds.IRS_LON,
        "alt": ds.IRS_ALT,
    })
```

This at least has a `time` coordinate.

```{code-cell} ipython3
dsfixed = fix_halo_ql(ds)
dsfixed
```

Just to have a better visual impression, we can create a quick overview plot of the data:

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.plot(dsfixed.lon, dsfixed.lat)
plt.show()
```

### Reducing the size of the dataset

Later on, we want to plot all flights on an interactive map. Currently the dataset is rather large as the aircraft location has been recorded continuously at a high data rate. While this is good for quantitative analysis, this leads to poor interactive performance. So before going further, it is a good idea to reduce the amount of data while keeping the visual impression.

A possible idea to reduce the amount of required data is that plotting a line already does linear interpolation between two coordinate points. So if we would remove those points which are close to the linear interpolation between its neighboring points, the visual impression will stay almost the same. This idea has already been stated by Ramer Douglas and Peucker and is illustrated at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm). Below is a simple implementation of that algorithm which also takes time into account.

```{note}
Many algorithms for shape processing are contained in the beautiful [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) library. If you are looking for a performant code, this or other shape processing libraries are a better choice. Nonetheless, having a quick look into some basic algorithms never hurts.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def _drp_argreduce_timeline(time, coords, start, end):
    if end < start + 2:
        return

    t1, t2 = time[[start, end]]
    c1, c2 = coords[[start, end]]

    t_intermediate = time[start + 1: end]
    c_true = coords[start + 1: end]

    f1 = ((t2 - t_intermediate) / (t2 - t1))[:, np.newaxis]
    c_interp = c1 * f1 + c2 * (1 - f1)

    diff = np.sum((c_true - c_interp) ** 2, axis=-1)
    max_idx = np.argmax(diff)
    if diff[max_idx] >= 1:
        splitpoint = max_idx + start + 1
        yield from _drp_argreduce_timeline(time, coords, start, splitpoint)
        yield splitpoint
        yield from _drp_argreduce_timeline(time, coords, splitpoint, end)


def drp_argreduce_timeline(time, coords, norm=1):
    """
    Computes important time points within a trajectory.
    
    Here, important is defined such that if in stead of taking the i-th coordinate
    from the input trajectory, that coordinate is interpolated from the output
    trajectory, the distance betwen the original and the interpolated point multiplied
    by `norm` is less than 1:
    
    $$
    distance(input_coord, interpolated outpu_coord) * norm <= 1
    $$
    
    That way, trajectory coordinates can be substantially compressed with configurable
    impact on data quality.
    """
    start = 0
    end = len(time)
    yield start
    yield from _drp_argreduce_timeline(time, coords * norm, start, end - 1)
    yield end - 1

def simplify_dataset(ds, tolerance):
    ds = ds.load()  # load dataset fully such that no single time points will be fetched
    indices_to_take = list(drp_argreduce_timeline(ds.time.values,
                                                  np.stack([ds.lat.values, ds.lon.values], axis=1),
                                                  1/tolerance))
    return ds.isel(time=indices_to_take)
```

We can now use that algorithm to generate a simplified version of the dataset with a tolerance of $10^{-5}$ degrees, which otherwise looks the same to the previous version.

```{code-cell} ipython3
dssimplified = simplify_dataset(dsfixed, 1e-5)
dssimplified
```

We can now compare those two tracks side by side while keeping a look at the number of data points required.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, (ax1, ax2) = subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15,4))
ax1.plot(dsfixed.lon, dsfixed.lat)
ax1.set_title(f"{len(dsfixed.time)} data points")
ax2.plot(dssimplified.lon, dssimplified.lat)
ax2.set_title(f"{len(dssimplified.time)} data points")
plt.show()
ratio = len(dssimplified.time) / len(dsfixed.time)
print(f"compression ratio: {ratio*100:.2f} %")
```

The dataset size has been substantially reduced while the visual impression stayed the same.

## First interactive map

In order to show the map a little bit more interactively, we use the [`ipyleaflet`](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library which creates a bridge between ipython and the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) JavaScript library.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import ipyleaflet
```

As we will need to convert many tracks to ipyleaflet layers later on, the easiest is to create a little function for that purpose right away:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def track2layer(track, color="green", name=""):
    return ipyleaflet.Polyline(
        locations=np.stack([track.lat.values, track.lon.values], axis=1).tolist(), 
        color=color,
        fill=False,
        weight=2,
        name=name
    )
```

With the help of that little function, creating a map is now like a breeze:

```{code-cell} ipython3
testmap = ipyleaflet.Map(center=(13.3, -57), zoom=7)
testmap.add_layer(track2layer(dssimplified))
display(testmap)
```

## All in one
Let's see if we can add all the flights and provide a layer switcher so that we can have a look at all flights individually. We'll start by loading and simplifying all out track data into a local dictionary:

```{code-cell} ipython3
tracks = {
    flight_id: simplify_dataset(fix_halo_ql(ds.get().to_dask()), 1e-5)
    for flight_id, ds in cat.HALO.BAHAMAS.QL.items()
}
```

Let's also quickly grab some colors from a matplotlib colorbar, such that we can show all tracks in individual colors:

```{code-cell} ipython3
colors = [matplotlib.colors.to_hex(c)
          for c in plt.cm.inferno(np.linspace(0, 1, len(tracks)))]
```

We can now start with a new empty map. Let's also have a different [basemap](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/basemaps.html).

```{code-cell} ipython3
m = ipyleaflet.Map(
    basemap=ipyleaflet.basemaps.Esri.NatGeoWorldMap,
    center=(13.3, -57), zoom=7
)
```

We'll add all the tracks as individual layers to the map

```{code-cell} ipython3
for (flight_id, track), color in zip(tracks.items(), colors):
    m.add_layer(track2layer(track, color, flight_id))
```

and add a scale, a legend, layer controls and a full screen button to the map and show it. If you want to zoom in, you can for example shift-click and drag a rectangle over the area you want to zoom in more closely.

```{code-cell} ipython3
m.add_control(ipyleaflet.ScaleControl(position='bottomleft'))
m.add_control(ipyleaflet.LegendControl(dict(zip(tracks, colors)), name="Flights", position="bottomright"))
m.add_control(ipyleaflet.LayersControl(position='topright'))
m.add_control(ipyleaflet.FullScreenControl())
display(m)
```
